## AegisMesh — AI-Driven Deception Mesh (Starter)

AegisMesh is an educational, modular project that simulates a small deception mesh: mesh nodes emit events, an analyzer scores them, and a sandbox placeholder is available for future detonation handling.

## Quick start (local)
1. Make sure you are inside the repo root:
   ```bash
   pwd
   # .../AegisMesh
